The project aims to analyze aviation accident data to provide actionable insights to guide the company in selecting the lowest-risk aircraft for its new aviation division. The project seeks to minimize operational risks and enhance decision-making in the company’s venture into the aviation industry by assessing aircraft safety through historical accident trends. We will use data-driven analysis to identify aircraft models with the least incidence of accidents or incidents, ultimately delivering key recommendations to support safe and strategic aircraft purchases.


### Business Problem

Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Business Understanding
The company is expanding into the aviation industry and aims to make informed decisions on purchasing and operating aircraft for commercial and private use. A thorough analysis of aviation accident data is needed to understand which aircraft models or types carry the least risk. This analysis will help the company minimize operational risks, prioritize safety, and make strategic investments in low-risk aircraft, ensuring a smooth and secure entry into the aviation sector. With a focus on reducing the likelihood of accidents, the company seeks insights that will guide its choices and protect its long-term financial interests.

The main objective of this project is to identify the lowest-risk aircraft by analyzing historical aviation accident data. The key question driving the analysis is: "Which aircraft models or types are associated with the least risk of accidents or incidents?" This will lead to actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use when deciding on aircraft purchases. By leveraging data-driven recommendations, the company will be better positioned to make safer, more cost-effective decisions in its new aviation venture.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical aviation accident data to identify the aircraft models or types that pose the least operational risk. By doing so, the company will be equipped with data-driven insights that can guide its decisions on which aircraft to purchase and operate for its new aviation business. This analysis aims to provide clear, actionable recommendations that prioritize safety and risk reduction, ensuring that the company’s expansion into aviation is both strategic and secure. Ultimately, the project seeks to align the company’s investment with the safest, most reliable aircraft options available.

## Data Understanding
In the Data Understanding phase, the focus is on gathering, exploring, and familiarizing ourselves with the aviation accident dataset. This step involves identifying the structure, quality, and key attributes of the data that will be used to assess aircraft safety. The dataset may contain variables such as aircraft model, type of incident, severity, date of occurrence, and contributing factors. A thorough initial review of the data helps to identify missing values, inconsistencies, or potential biases, ensuring that the data is reliable and suitable for analysis. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can uncover patterns and trends, such as which aircraft models have been involved in the fewest or least severe accidents.

Additionally, this phase helps to assess whether the available data sufficiently answers the key research question: which aircraft models have the lowest risk of accidents? It also allows us to determine if supplementary data sources, such as aircraft maintenance records or operational history, may be needed to enhance the analysis. Understanding the relationships between variables will provide the foundation for more advanced modeling and insights in later stages. The quality and completeness of the data at this stage are crucial for ensuring that the final recommendations are based on accurate and meaningful insights.
