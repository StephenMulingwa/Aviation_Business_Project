With the interest that has emerged recently from our company to expand to diversify its portfolio particularly in the Aviation Industry. I Stephen Mulingwa as the senior Data anlyst of the Company analyzed the aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering civil aviation incidents from 1962 to 2023. Hence, through this project I will provide you with the actionable insights to guide the company in selecting the lowest-risk aircrafts for commercial and private enterprises. This project seeks to minimize operational risks and enhance decision-making in the company’s venture into the aviation industry by assessing aircraft safety through historical accident trends. I have used data-driven analysis to identify aircraft makes and models with the least incidence of accidents or incidents, ultimately delivering key recommendations to support safe and strategic aircraft purchases.

### Business Problem
The objectives for this project aviation business venture are:
* To assess Aviation Accident Risk: I will analyze historical aviation accident data to identify aircraft models with the lowest incidence of accidents or incidents, ensuring the selection of the safest options for the company’s venture.
* To minimize Operational Risk: I will provide actionable insights that will guide the company in minimizing operational risks as it expands into the aviation industry by focusing on safety metrics.
* I will offer Strategic Decisions: Deliver data-driven recommendations that will assist the head of the aviation division in making informed decisions regarding aircraft purchases for both commercial and private operations.

## Business Understanding
The company is expanding into the aviation industry and aims to make informed decisions on purchasing and operating aircraft for commercial and private use. The primary stakeholder is the Head of the Aviation Division, who is responsible for overseeing the selection and operation of aircraft for commercial and private ventures. The key business questions to address in this project are:

* Which aircraft models have the lowest risk of accidents or incidents?
This question focuses on identifying the safest aircraft based on historical data, ensuring that the company invests in models with proven safety records.

* What are the major factors contributing to aviation accidents, and how can the company mitigate these risks?
By understanding the common causes of accidents, the company can make informed choices about aircraft maintenance, pilot training, and operational protocols.

* How does the frequency of accidents differ across different aircraft types, manufacturers, or operational conditions?
This question seeks to uncover patterns and trends in the data, allowing the company to select aircraft that are best suited for their intended use while minimizing risk.

The answers to these key questions will enable the company make data-driven decisions in the new aviation venture, reducing risk and ensuring safe and strategic aircraft purchases.


## Data Understanding and Analysis
### Source of data
The dataset used for this analysis comes from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and contains information on aviation accidents and selected incidents involving civil aviation in the United States and international waters. The data spans from 1948 to 2022 and includes various details related to accident occurrences, purpose of the flight, aircraft involved, and weather conditions at the time of the incidents.

### Description of Data
The dataset contains 90,348 records with 31 columns, covering various aspects of aviation accidents, including:
* Event Date: The date when the aviation accident or incident occurred.
* Location: Geographic location where the incident took place.
* Aircraft Make and Model: The manufacturer and specific model of the aircraft involved in the accident.
* Aircraft Category: The type or category of the aircraft (e.g., commercial, private).
* Aircraft Damage: Details about the severity of the aircraft damage (e.g., Destroyed, Substantial, Minor, Unknown).
* Injury Severity: The level of injuries sustained (e.g., fatal, non-fatal, incident).
* Weather Conditions: Information on the weather conditions at the time of the incident.
* Probable Cause: The identified or suspected cause(s) of the accident.
* Purpose of flight (e.g., personal, instructional, business)
